# KAOS Definition Document for Project Structuring Framework

## 1. **Goal Modeling Overview**
This document provides a detailed specification for developing a framework that integrates KAOS goal modeling with Gherkin syntax for project definition. The framework will support the hierarchical decomposition of projects into work packages, with requirements expressed in Gherkin syntax to ensure traceability and completeness across different levels.

### 1.1 **High-Level Goal**
- **Goal**: Develop a Project Structuring Framework that uses KAOS for goal modeling and Gherkin syntax for requirements specification, enabling the hierarchical decomposition of projects into work packages.

### 1.2 **Context**
- **Stakeholders**:
  - **Project Managers**: Use the framework to define, organize, and manage projects.
  - **Business Analysts**: Use KAOS models to align goals with requirements and operational needs.
  - **Developers/Testers**: Use Gherkin syntax to express and validate requirements for each work package.

## 2. **Goal Decomposition**

### 2.1 **Goal 1: Develop Goal-Based Project Hierarchy**
- **Sub-Goals**:
  1. **Define Project-Level Goals**:
     - **AND Decomposition**: Break down high-level project goals into manageable sub-goals, reflecting different aspects of the project.
  2. **Create Hierarchical Work Packages**:
     - **Sub-Goals**:
       - **Design Work Package Templates**: To represent high-level goals and requirements.
       - **Enable Selective Inheritance in Nested Work Packages**: Work packages should inherit relevant goals and requirements selectively, allowing customization at each level.

### 2.2 **Goal 2: Enable Requirements Specification Using Gherkin Syntax**
- **Sub-Goals**:
  1. **Define Requirement Templates in Gherkin Syntax**:
     - Use the "Given-When-Then" structure for requirements.
     - Extend the Gherkin syntax using natural language if necessary, ensuring that it remains intuitive and project-specific.
  2. **Link Requirements to Goals**:
     - Ensure each Gherkin-defined requirement is manually tagged and traceable to a specific KAOS goal.
  3. **Provide Traceability Mechanism**:
     - Ensure traceability of all requirements from sub-packages to their parent work packages, ensuring completeness and alignment.

### 2.3 **Goal 3: Ensure Hierarchical Consistency**
- **Sub-Goals**:
  1. **Validate Consistency Across Levels**:
     - Ensure that all sub-requirements align with their parent work package requirements.
  2. **Automate Consistency Checks**:
     - Develop tools to automate the validation of consistency across work packages, checking whether the sub-requirements collectively satisfy their parent requirements.

## 3. **Responsibility Assignment**

### 3.1 **Agents and Responsibilities**
- **Project Manager Agent**:
  - Responsible for defining high-level goals and breaking them down into work packages.
- **Business Analyst Agent**:
  - Responsible for ensuring alignment between goals and requirements.
  - Responsible for operationalizing high-level goals into specific requirements.
- **Developer Agent**:
  - Responsible for implementing Gherkin-defined requirements for each work package.
- **Tester Agent**:
  - Ensure that implemented requirements fulfill the specified Gherkin scenarios and achieve the intended goals.

## 4. **Obstacle Analysis**

### 4.1 **Potential Obstacles and Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Obstacle**: Ambiguity in Requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Use clear templates and enforce Gherkin syntax standards to minimize ambiguity.
2. **Obstacle**: Lack of Traceability
   - **Mitigation**: Ensure full traceability by implementing manual tagging of KAOS goals with Gherkin requirements.
3. **Obstacle**: Misalignment of Sub-Goals
   - **Mitigation**: Validate sub-goals through automated consistency checks and manual reviews by business analysts.
4. **Obstacle**: Mission-Critical Obstacle Prioritization
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize obstacles based on their criticality to the mission and focus mitigation efforts accordingly.

## 5. **Operationalization of Goals**

### 5.1 **Goal Operationalization Examples**
- **Goal**: "Enable Nested Work Packages"
  - **Operational Requirement**: "Provide a RESTful API to create and manage work packages and their nested structure."
  - **Gherkin Requirement Example**:
    ```gherkin
    Scenario: Create a nested work package
    Given an API endpoint to manage work packages
    When a request is made to add a new sub-work package under an existing work package
    Then the response should indicate that the new work package is successfully linked as a child of the selected parent work package
    ```

### 5.2 **Linking Requirements to Goals**
- Each Gherkin requirement scenario is manually tagged and linked to one or more goals in the KAOS model, ensuring that all functionality directly contributes to achieving project objectives.

## 6. **Traceability and Validation**

- **Requirement Management in Markdown**: Requirements will be managed in Markdown files with the extension `*.requirement.md` in a hierarchical directory structure. The directory structure does not necessarily reflect the requirement hierarchy. The entry point for each directory is `index.requirement.md`, while other requirements are called `IMPLEMENTATION.requirement.md`. This approach allows linking `*.requirement.md` files to implementation files such as `*.java` or `*.cpp`. The requirement files shall be interwoven by Markdown linking; if a work package is implemented by a set of sub-work packages, they shall be listed and referenced in the parent work package file using Markdown links.
- **Traceability Matrix**: A traceability matrix will be generated for each project, linking KAOS goals to Gherkin requirements, ensuring that all project-level goals are covered by specific requirements.
- **Validation Mechanism**:
  - Automated tests will validate that all sub-requirements across work packages collectively satisfy the parent requirements.
  - CI pipelines will be integrated to support automated consistency checks and validation processes.

## 7. **Conclusion**
This refined KAOS definition document outlines the structured approach to building a framework that integrates KAOS goal modeling and Gherkin syntax for hierarchical project breakdown. Goals are decomposed systematically, responsibilities assigned, obstacles prioritized, and requirements operationalized to ensure consistency, traceability, and validation across project levels.
