## 1. **Overview**
This document describes the requirement for implementing the project structuring framework as outlined in the KAOS definition document. The framework shall be implemented using the **NestJS** framework, a popular Node.js framework, to provide the RESTful API for managing work packages and their requirements.

### 1.1 **High-Level Goal**
- **Goal**: Develop a RESTful API using **NestJS** to manage hierarchical work packages, linking requirements to goals as defined in the KAOS model, and providing capabilities to maintain traceability across different project levels.

## 2. **Functional Requirements**
### 2.1 **API Endpoints**
The RESTful API shall provide the following endpoints:

1. **Create a Work Package**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /work-packages`
   - **Description**: Create a new work package with the specified details.
   - **Request Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "string",
       "description": "string",
       "parentPackagePath": "string (optional)"
     }
     ```
   - **Response**:
     - **201 Created**: Returns the created work package details.
     - **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data.

2. **Retrieve a Work Package**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /work-packages/{id}`
   - **Description**: Retrieve details of a specific work package by its directory path.
   - **Response**:
     - **200 OK**: Returns the work package details.
     - **404 Not Found**: Work package not found.

3. **Update a Work Package**
   - **Endpoint**: `PUT /work-packages/{id}`
   - **Description**: Update the details of an existing work package by its directory path.
   - **Request Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "string (optional)",
       "description": "string (optional)",
       "parentPackagePath": "string (optional)"
     }
     ```
   - **Response**:
     - **200 OK**: Returns the updated work package details.
     - **404 Not Found**: Work package not found.

4. **Delete a Work Package**
   - **Endpoint**: `DELETE /work-packages/{id}`
   - **Description**: Delete a specific work package by its directory path.
   - **Response**:
     - **204 No Content**: Successful deletion.
     - **404 Not Found**: Work package not found.

5. **List All Work Packages**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /work-packages`
   - **Description**: Retrieve a list of all work packages, optionally filtered by the parent package directory.
   - **Response**:
     - **200 OK**: Returns a list of work packages.

6. **Provide OpenAPI Specification**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /openapi.yaml`
   - **Description**: Retrieve the OpenAPI specification for this server in the form of a static YAML file.
   - **Response**:
     - **200 OK**: Returns the OpenAPI YAML specification file describing all the available endpoints and their respective definitions.

### 2.2 **Linking Requirements to Work Packages**
- **Link Requirements Endpoint**: Provide an endpoint to link specific requirements (represented by markdown files) to a work package.
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /work-packages/{id}/link-requirement`
  - **Description**: Link a requirement markdown file to the specified work package by its directory path.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "requirementPath": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    - **200 OK**: Returns the updated work package details with linked requirement.
    - **404 Not Found**: Work package not found.

## 3. **Non-Functional Requirements**
### 3.1 **Technology Stack**
- **NestJS**: The primary framework for implementing the RESTful API.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Filesystem Operations**: For handling file-based interactions and managing work package persistence in the filesystem.
- **Filesystem**: Requirements and work packages are stored as markdown files (`*.requirement.md`) in a hierarchical directory structure.

### 3.2 **Performance**
- The API should be capable of handling **100 concurrent requests** with a response time under **500 ms** for 90% of requests.

### 3.3 **Security**
- **Authentication**: The API shall use **Basic Authentication** for securing endpoints.
- **Authorization**: Only a single role shall be allowed to perform CRUD operations on work packages.

## 4. **Traceability and Validation**
### 4.1 **Traceability**
- Each API endpoint shall be linked to one or more goals defined in the KAOS model.
- Requirements managed in markdown files (`*.requirement.md`) shall be referenced in their respective work packages, ensuring traceability.

### 4.2 **Validation**
- Unit tests shall be written for each endpoint using **Jest** to ensure correctness of functionality.
- **Integration tests** shall validate that the linked requirements are properly associated with the correct work packages.

## 5. **Conclusion**
This requirement document specifies the implementation of the project structuring framework using NestJS to provide the RESTful API. The API will enable managing work packages, linking requirements, and maintaining consistency with KAOS goals.
